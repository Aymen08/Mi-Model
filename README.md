# Presentation

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the paper "An Ensemble of Simple Convolutional Neural Network Models for MNIST Digit Recognition" [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10400).

# Dependencies

All needed packages are in requirements.txt file.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Hyper Parameters

All needed Hyper parameters are defined in config.py file.

# Training 

To start training use 

```
pyton train.py
```
it will create the model in output_models/ directory.


# TODO 

Add ema of weights for evaluation.
